Objectives:
    -Figure out how to load the binary matrix (currently in components folder) and simply just print it
    -Next, modify the Grid constructor to check the state for a state change, triggered by the button, and construct the grid w/ the file as reference or normally dependent on state
    
    -Once we can, at a minimum, load the txt grids and stuff, we can begin working on writing the actual A* algorithm

    -BEFORE working on algorithm:
        -Create a "starting" cell css class
        -Create an "ending" cell css class
        -Use event handlers to setthe start and end cells

    -A* Algorithm:
        -



    -Other things to consider:
        -Allowing users to draw their own walls
        -Adding animation
        -Allowing users to change the size of their grid
